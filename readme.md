Backstory: One of my friends who is looking for a job came accross this website, he applied for a job and filled in the details, In the interview without going into much technical details the interviewer offered my friend the job, that's when he got skeptical, we checked website it seemed fishy, we checked linkdin and could'nt find any reference to the company and as he guessed they called after one day and demanded 2,000 Rs for registeration. 

Project: This is a selenium based project which will automate the form filling process and will spam the fraudsters.
